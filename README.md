# NeuralNets
Created a neural network to classify MNIST images

In this project I used Java to build a functional neural network. The MNIST database was split into traning, validation, testing subsets. The network was initialized with neurons of random weights, then was trained on the training data until the network achieved a validation threshold with the validation data. The  network is then tested on the testing set to determine the final accuracy. Additionally, the GUI allows a user to sketch a digit after the network has been trained, and the network attempts to classify the drawn digit.
